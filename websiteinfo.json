  "aboutProject": "<p>This <strong>Particle System and Multiple Lights</strong> demonstration was created during my 3rd year of University, with the help of my fellow student <a href='http://nightshiftgames.co.uk/'>Mark Smellie</a>. We were tasked with creating three advanced graphics techniques which could be showcased in one application.</p><p>I chose to implement a <strong>Particle System</strong> which would simulate fireworks, each of which had a randomised colour, location and length of time until explosion. Mark chose to implement a scene which would feature multiple lights, each with their own colour and luminosity.</p><p>Finally our two projects were merged and each firework was given its own light source and the particles would match the colour of the light. Between us we also implemented <strong>Bump Mapping</strong> into the scene, to give the environment some realistic detail.</p>",
